# Keyboard Firmware

This is a repo filled with firmware for my various mechanical keyboards and keyboard projects.

## Installation - QMK

Before you try to use any of the posted firmware, please follow the [QMK guide on setting up a development eviornment](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started)
Once you have a proper build enviornment setup, clone the keyboards folder in this repo to the keyboards folder of your development enviornment, after doing so edit the keymap file as you'd please to accomodate your preferred layout [(QMK Guide)](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware)
You're now ready to [flash your firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_flashing). Generally this is done with `qmk flash -kb keyboard -km default`
